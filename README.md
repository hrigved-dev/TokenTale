## Abstract

* Current social media applications are not built for NFTs to be posted on them because the proof of ownership becomes an issue, which Token Tale aims to solve.
* TokenTale aims at providing an effective solution where people can flaunt the NFTs they own without thinking about the same NFT being posted by another user
* TokenTale also provides a way to tip the owner of an NFT if a user likes it.
